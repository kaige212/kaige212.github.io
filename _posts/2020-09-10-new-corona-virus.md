W New research suggests huge floods once flowed through an area on Mars. Scientists say the finding could be a new sign that the planet may have once had the right conditions to support some form of life.

The evidence comes from data collected by NASA's Curiosity rover, an exploration vehicle. Curiosity landed on Mars in 2012 and has been exploring the planet's Gale Crater ever since. Scientists believe Gale Crater was formed when a meteor hit Mars in its early history, about 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago.

Scientists have already collected evidence suggesting that Mars once had a lot of water. In 2015, NASA's Curiosity team said the rover had gathered evidence showing that the Red Planet could have stored water in large lakes billions of years ago.

**nine koronuan viru**

Quite simple, right? Though the words have been changed in some way, they're still very easy to be recognized by an Indo-European language speaker, especially an English speaker.

The changed part, word rhyme, is helpful for Chinese speakers.  It's still a little bit hard for Chinese though.  To help more, Globien has another style for biginners from Chinese speakers:  

**nin<sup>x</sup>e koronuan<sup>g</sup> viru<sup>d</sup>**

The superscript is not a portion of a word.  It's just a hint.  An Indo-European speaker call always ignore them safely.

By the way, the expression for "pandemic" is: **gronde infekanze malindeo**.  It's a little bit long, but as an IAL and for the sake of simpleness, Globien won't build too many words as that in English.  Also, an Indo-European speaker can easily recognize this phrase.
